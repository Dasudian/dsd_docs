# Logs

DSDB writes log output, by default, to `stderr`.
Depending on your use case, this log information can be written to another location.

## Running DSDB directly

If you run DSDB directly, using `influxd`, all logs will be written to `stderr`.
You may redirect this log output as you would any output to `stderr` like so:

```sh
influxd 2>$HOME/my_log_file
```

## Launched as a service

If DSDB was installed using a pre-built package, and then launched as a service, `stderr` is redirected to `/var/log/dsdb/influxd.log`, and all log data will be written to that file.
You can override this location by setting the variable `STDERR` in the file `/etc/default/dsdb`.

>**Note:** On OSX the logs, by default, are stored in the file `/usr/local/var/log/dsdb.log`
 
For example, if `/etc/default/dsdb` contains:

```sh
STDERR=/dev/null
```

all log data will be discarded.
You can similarly direct output to `stdout` by setting `STDOUT` in the same file.
Output to `stdout` is sent to `/dev/null` by default when DSDB is launched as a service.

DSDB must be restarted to pick up any changes to `/etc/default/dsdb`.


## Using logrotate

You can use [logrotate](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man8/logrotate.8.html) to rotate the log files generated by DSDB.
If using the package install, the config file for logrotate is installed in `/etc/logrotate.d`.
You can view the file [here](https://github.com/dsdb/dsdb/blob/master/scripts/logrotate).
