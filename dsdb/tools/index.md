## Tools

### [Shell(CLI)](/dsdb/tools/shell.md)

The DSDB shell is an interactive shell for DSDB and the recommended *ad hoc* method of using the HTTP API.

### [Web Admin](/dsdb/tools/web_admin.md)

The built-in web administration GUI is a simple way to interact with DSDB.
For any significant use, whether writing or querying data, the HTTP API is the preferred method.

### [Grafana Graphs and Dashboards](/dsdb/tools/grafana.md)

Grafana is a convenient dashboard tool for visuallizing time series data.
It was originally built for Graphite, modeled after Kibana, and since been updated to support DSDB.
Almost all Grafana documentation for DSDB version 0.9 will apply to DSDB version 1.0.

### [Telegraf](https://github.com/dasudian/telegraf)

Telegraf is an open source tool for metrics collection (e.g. CollectD) built and maintained by the DSDB team.
