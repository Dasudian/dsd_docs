# API Client Libraries

This is a list of the client libraries which have some support for DSDB version 1.0.
Most should be fully compatible with DSDB version 1.0. 
Functionality will vary with the continuous development of DSDB and there are, as yet, no standard features that all libraries must implement in order to be listed here.
Libraries that have been updated for DSDB version 1.0 are listed in **bold**.
